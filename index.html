        I wanted to write this because when I talk, I sometimes mess things up.
        Writing helps me slow down.
      </p>

      <p>
        I care about you. In a real way.
        I notice how deeply you feel things, and I know that’s part of who you are.
        I don’t take that lightly.

        I’ve been thinking about what I said, and I understand why it hurt.
        The way it came out made it sound like I value a girlfriend less,
        and only take a wife seriously.
      </p>

      <p>
        That isn’t what I believe.
        But I was careless. I didn’t think through my words,
        and I didn’t stop to consider how they would land on you.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s on me.

        I wasn’t trying to make you feel small or undervalued.
        I was stupid with my wording, not careless with you.

      <p>
        You don’t need to reply to this.
        There’s nothing you need to explain or fix.
        I just wanted you to know I understand what I did wrong.
