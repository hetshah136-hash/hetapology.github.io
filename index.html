                I've been thinking about you a lot lately. Not in a way that feels heavy, 
                just in the way you think about someone when they matter.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like the way you are with people. How you listen, even when you're tired. 
                How you notice things. The way you care about getting things right.
            </p>
            <p>
                I don't always say it clearly, but you make things feel less complicated. 
                Like I can just be myself and that's enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm glad you're in my life.

                I need to apologize.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was careless with my words. I said things without thinking about how they'd land, 
                and I can see now that it hurt you. That's on me.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wasn't paying attention the way I should have been. You deserved better than that. 
                I'm sorry.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can't take it back, but I can do better going forward. And I will.

                You don't have to respond to this. You don't owe me anything. 
                Not forgiveness, not a reply, not your time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I just wanted you to know that I see what I did, and I'm taking responsibility for it. 
                Not because I expect something back, but because it's the right thing to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whatever you need right now, I hope you give that to yourself.
